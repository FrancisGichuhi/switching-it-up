# Switching It Up

## Instructions

In the initial commit to this project, you have been provided with files that contain a JavaScript module and some associated tests. Currently the calculateScore function is causing the tests to fail. Your task is to rework this function so that it works as expected, making the tests pass. This exercise will be completed in class with instuctor assistance.

## Provided Files

**.eslintrc.js** - a config file for eslint

**scoring.js** - this file contains a JavaScript module called scoring with a `calculateScore` function. This function calls all of the other calculation functions to get a total score.

**tests.js** - this file contains tests for the `calculateScore` function in the `scoring` module

**package.json** - this file sets up the Node project including all the dev dependencies

**.gitattributes** - this file makes sure that git behaves the way we need it to for Windows machines

**.gitignore** - this file sets the project up to ignore the node_modules folder when committing to git

## Exercise Submission

You should submit your working changes in a pull request.
